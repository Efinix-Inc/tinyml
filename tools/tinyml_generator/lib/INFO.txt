1. Efinix TinyML platform supports .tflite model with full integer quantization.
2. LITE accelerator is a lightweight accelerator with less resource usage. 
3. STANDARD accelerator is a high performance accelerator with more resource usage.
4. TinyML cache is an optional feature to speed-up data access of STANDARD mode accelerator.
5. Supports Single Core and Multi-Core designs
   - Single Core : Generates a define.v file for a single-channel TinyML accelerator.
   - Multi-Core : Generates a define.v file for multi-core designs targeting different cores. 
                  Seperate define.v file must be generated for each target core, ensuring it includes the required model configuration.
6. Resource Estimator estimates resource usage of TinyML accelerator based on configured parameter setting for Efinix Titanium FPGAs. Open .tflite model file to get started.
